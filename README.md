# Data Structures Phase 1

## Project Description

This project is a basic implementation of a streaming service. It manages movie records across different categories, tracks user activity, and makes movie recommendations. The primary 
focus is on the efficient use of data structures, including linked lists, stacks, and arrays.

Movies are categorized into six genres:
- Horror
- Science-Fiction
- Drama
- Romance
- Documentary
- Comedy
  
Each user and movie has a unique identifier and is associated with relevant structures that allow for efficient data manipulation and retrieval.

## Features

- **User Registration & Management:** Add and remove users from the service.
- **Movie Management:** Add movies to a catalog, categorize them, and manage their availability.
- **Viewing History:** Maintain a stack-based watch history for each user.
- **Movie Suggestions:** Generate recommendations based on other users’ watch histories.
- **Filtered Searches:** Allow users to search for movies by category and release year.
- **Data Output:** Print summaries of movies and user information.

## Data Structures
- **Category List (Array):** Array of six linked lists, each representing a genre. Movies in each genre are stored in sorted order based on their unique identifier (mid).
- **User List (Linked List):** An unsorted singly linked list containing all registered users.
- **Watch History (Stack):** A stack structure to maintain each user’s watch history, storing the movies they have watched.
- **Suggested Movies List (Doubly Linked List):** A list to maintain suggested movies for each user.
- **New Movies List (Linked List):** Temporarily holds newly added movies until they are assigned to a category.
